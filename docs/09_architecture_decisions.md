# Architecture Decisions

=== ADR 001: We use ADRs to justify our architectural decisions

Status: Draft 
Elaborated by: Somebody 
Decided by: ./. 
Decided on: ./. 
Expiry date: 2042-08-15

==== Context and problem statement

Architectural decisions should be documented in such a way that their drivers and any excluded alternatives are documented so that they can be reviewed in the future.

==== Decision

The ADR format was chosen because it is a relatively concise documentation option for decisions.
It is easy to edit and can contain both simple decisions and lists of alternative options as well as the criteria for the decision made.

=== ADR 002: Documentation

Status: Draft
Prepared by: Somebody 
Decided by: - 
Decided on: -
Expiry date: -

==== Context

Architecture documentation is important for the sustainable development of software. In order to create uniformity, it makes sense to discuss, make, document and communicate certain decisions.

==== Decision

A team must document its architecture.
The standardised format for architecture documentation is https://arc42.org[arc42].
The architecture documentation must always be available to stakeholders. Like Github pages.
